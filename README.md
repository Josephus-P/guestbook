- Run `yarn install` in the root directory to install server dependencies
- Run `knex migrate:latest` to setup the local database (Make sure you have the `Knex CLI` installed).
- Run `yarn dev` in the root directory to start the server with nodemon
- Run `yarn install` in the client directory to install client dependencies
- Run `yarn start` in the client directory to start the client app
